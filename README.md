# BitWizards
Bitwizards is a team of enthusiastic beginners who came together to learn, experiment, and create something meaningful. For our hackathon project, we built GreenRent, a simple and eco-friendly rental platform. We focused on clear design, easy navigation, and features like FAQs, login, and cart to make the user experience smooth.
